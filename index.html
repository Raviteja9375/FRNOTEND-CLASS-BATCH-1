 <p>Virat Kohli needs no introduction. Former India captain relinquished his role as captain for the Royal Challengers Bangalore after having led the franchise for 9 years. 
He made his IPL debut in the first-ever match of the IPL on April 18th, 2008 against Kolkata Knight Riders at RCB’s home ground, M.Chinnaswamy Stadium. 
Virat Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the IPL and holds the record for the most number of centuries (4) in an IPL season.</p>

 <h3> <b> Dinesh Karthik (WICKET KEEPER)</b></h3> 
<img src="assets/DK-img-6.png" alt width="350" srcset="">
<p>Dinesh Karthik, the man who was responsible for India’s incredible win against Bangladesh in the Nidahas Trophy final, 
  will be donning the RCB jersey for the second time. An incredibly fine wicket-keeper and a decent striker of the ball who can brew a storm if he gets going, 
  Karthik stirred the paddles for quite a significant number of times. 
  Royal Challengers Bangalore wrested him from the jaws of Chennai Super Kings after an intense bidding war for Rs 5.50 crore.</p>

  <h4> <b>GLENN MAXWELL (ALL-ROUNDER):</b></h4>
  <img src="assets/maxwell-img-8.png" alt width="450" srcset="">
 <p>Glenn Maxwell is the fastest batsman to reach 3,000 ODI runs in terms of balls (2440) faced. 
   He also holds the record for scoring the fastest ODI ton (51 deliveries) for an Australian. 
   The 32-year-old has the third highest individual score (145*) in T20Is. During the 2021 IPL Auction, 
   Maxwell was signed by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for a massive sum of INR 14.25 Crores.</p>

  <h2> <b>Sanju Samson (Captain & wicketkeeper-batsman ) : </b></h2>
  <img src="assets/Sanju samson-img-2.png" alt width="300" srcset="">
  Sanju Samson came into reckoning with his gritty knocks for Rajasthan Royals in his debut season for the franchise. 
  The wicketkeeper-batsman from Kerala was groomed by Rahul Dravid into a tough campaigner. 
  He joined the Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) squad in 2016 and played some crucial innings for the team during his two seasons with them before moving back to Rajasthan Royals. 
  Sanju scored 342 runs in IPL 2019 and then followed it up with 375 runs in the IPL 2020. 
  He was moved into senior position when named captain for the 2021 season. 
  Now that he is into his 2nd season as the leader of the pack and with the addition of some established seniors joining RR, 
  one can surely hope for an improved show from this team.

  <h3> <b>Jos Buttler ( wicketkeeper-batsman ) :</b></h3>
  <img src="assets/Jos Buttler-img-3.png" alt width="300" srcset="">
  <p>The swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman will be out to make an impact as RR hope to utilise his international experience to guide them and end their long run for a second title.
     The right-hander had scored 328 runs in the IPL 2020. While he had to leave IPL 2019 midway to join the England team for the World Cup 2019 preparations, 
     he made an impact during his eight-game stint, scoring 311 runs, following his 548-run season in IPL 2018. 
     Buttler has since then added a World Cup glory to his feather but didn’t quite have the best of seasons with RR as he scored 254 runs in 7 matches, 
     including a sterling century in 2021. Being a senior member of the squad and someone who was retained before the auction, 
    Buttler will have a crucial role to play in the leadership group first and then set the stage on fire with his attractive stroke play.</p>

<P> The left-arm medium-pacer from Tamil Nadu is known for his bowling abilities in the domestic T20 circuit wherein he has sprung up match-winning performances for Tamil Nadu.
  It came as a pleasant surprise when he was the highest-paid uncapped Indian player, picked up by Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) in 2017.
  He played 6 games for the franchise but had just 2 wickets to his name. In the 2020 IPL edition though,
  Natarajan put up a breakthrough performance picking up 16 wickets in 16 games.
  His bowling abilities earned him a T20I &ODI call-up in Australia and was soon drafted into the Test fold as well in 2021.
  He played just 2 games in the 2021 IPL and missed the rest of the season due to an injury.In 2022,
  Natarajan will be looking to get back to his old wicket-taking self when he walks out in orange for the Sunrisers Hyderabad.</P>
